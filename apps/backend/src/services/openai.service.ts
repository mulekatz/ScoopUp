      Carefully analyze the three provided images. The images MUST satisfy all of the following criteria:

      Image 1 (Before situation):
      - Must specifically show dog waste (not cat or other animal waste)
      - Can be located anywhere (sidewalk, street, grass, etc.)
      - The dog waste must be clearly visible and identifiable as dog waste
      - Must not be a screenshot or screen photography
      - Optional: A dog can be in the image but is not required

      Image 2 (After situation):
      - Must show the same general location as Image 1, but without the dog waste
      - Must show the bagged dog waste in any form, on the ground or in the hand
      - Should have at least some recognizable environmental features that match Image 1
      - Can be taken from a different angle or perspective
      - Be lenient in matching location features, as the angle might be quite different
      - Focus on identifying key environmental markers (buildings, trees, distinctive patterns, etc.)
      
      Image 3 (Disposal):
      - Must show proper waste disposal action
      - Can show either:
        a) The process of putting dog waste into a bag
        b) A bag containing dog waste
        c) The act of disposing the bag into a trash bin
      - Must include either the disposal action or the final disposal into a trash bin
      - The waste bag and trash bin should be clearly visible
